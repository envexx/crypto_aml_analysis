Crypto Transaction Pattern Analysis for AML Compliance
Show Image
üìä Project Summary
This project develops a comprehensive analytics system to support Anti-Money Laundering (AML) compliance on cryptocurrency transaction platforms. By implementing data engineering techniques, machine learning algorithms, and interactive data visualizations, the system enables the detection of suspicious transaction patterns and high-risk users.
Key Statistics

203,768 Transactions analyzed
1,000 Users profiled
14 Suspicious Users identified
42,019 Suspicious Transactions detected

üîé Key Features
1. Transaction Label Distribution Analysis
Show Image
Analysis shows that the majority of transactions (77.1%) lack clear labels (unknown), while 20.6% of transactions are identified as illicit, and only 2.23% are classified as licit. The high proportion of unlabeled and illicit transactions highlights the importance of advanced detection systems.
2. Transaction Volume Monitoring
Show Image
The transaction volume exhibits significant fluctuations over time, with peaks reaching approximately 8,000 transactions and troughs around 1,000 transactions. This pattern analysis helps identify unusual spikes that may signal coordinated suspicious activities.
3. User Profiling
Show Image
The distribution of transaction counts per user reveals a distinct bimodal pattern, with most users having very few transactions, while a small group of users execute a significantly higher number of transactions (around 800+). This pattern suggests potential structuring or smurfing activities.
4. Advanced Anomaly Detection
Show Image
Our advanced anomaly detection system identifies 1.4% of users as potentially suspicious, using multiple machine learning algorithms including Isolation Forest, Local Outlier Factor, and One-Class SVM.
5. Suspicious User Identification
Show Image
The system successfully identified 14 suspicious users with anomalous transaction patterns. These users displayed extremely high transaction volumes (816 transactions) completed within very short timeframes (1 day), resulting in unusually high transactions per day metrics.
üìà Methodology
This project employs a multi-faceted approach to AML compliance:

Data Integration - Merging transaction data with user KYC information
Feature Engineering - Creating behavioral indicators for anomaly detection
Machine Learning - Implementing multiple anomaly detection algorithms
Ensemble Techniques - Combining multiple model outputs for higher confidence
Risk Scoring - Developing a comprehensive risk assessment framework
Interactive Visualization - Building a real-time monitoring dashboard

üìä Interactive Dashboard
An interactive Streamlit dashboard was developed to allow compliance officers to:

Filter transactions by time period, label, and KYC level
Visualize transaction patterns and anomalies
Drill down into specific suspicious users
Download reports for further investigation
